       "\"Ok,Badhiya h..,The attachments could have been a bit longer,This beater is less than half the price of regular branded ones but seems to do the job well.Not sure about heavy duty use but extremely handy for whisking eggs, ice cream, meringue, or light cake batters.This is the exact same beater that seems to be available under many names on this site with prices ranging between 430 to 599 (as of Dec 2022) so if buying pick the cheapest available price like I did.It doesn't come with any warranty, but I took a chance and seems to have paid off.,Ko,Have been using it for months and still it works smoothly. It's very easy to use and clean and is effective. Go for it,It's one of the most Convenient product and multiple use. It's durable and easy to use. I really like this product. 10/10.Must buy it.,Great product! Value for money. Go for it!\""
